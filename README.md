This repository contains the code implementing the attacks against PROV described in the paper "Polynomial-Time Key-Recovery Attack on the PROV Specification", by River Moreira Ferreira and Ludovic Perret in 2024.
We recall than we takes as reference the implementation of Pierre PÃ©bereau with the paper "One vector to rule them all: Key recovery from one vector in UOV schemes" in 2023. 


The code should be executed on a machine with sagemath 9.5 avalaible, with the following command:
```
$ sage Attack.sage
```

The attack can be performed on every security levels with parameter suggested in PROV specification. The security level can be choosed with the following command where n equals 1,3 or 5.
```
$ sage Attack.sage n
```
If the parameter n is ommited (or incorrect ), the attack is performed on the security level 1.
